# Honeycomb hardware cheat sheet

I'm collecting here some information about Honeycomb hardware so that I can map controls and lights more easily.

* [Control mappings for the Honeycomb Bravo](./bravo-controls.md)
  - A full listing of *all* the controls on the Bravo, their default bindings, and how to fix the ones that are broken
* [How the lights on the Honeycomb Bravo work](./bravo-lights.md)
  - Full technical details of how to take control of all of the Bravo lights
